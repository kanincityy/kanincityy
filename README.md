# Hi, I’m Tatiana!

I'm a multilingual NLP and AI enthusiast completing my MSc in **Language Sciences: Technology of Language and Speech** at UCL. I specialise in **machine learning for language and speech**, with a focus on **low-resource NLP**, **speech emotion recognition**, and **LLM-powered applications**.

My mission is to build **human-centred AI systems** that make language technologies more inclusive, accessible, and responsible.

---

## 🔬 Research & Technical Interests
- **Multilingual NLP**: Cross-lingual transfer learning, hate speech detection, low-resource language tools  
- **Speech Technology**: Emotion recognition, noise-robust models, assistive tech for accessibility  
- **LLMs & Prompt Engineering**: GPT-3/4 integrations for structured-to-natural language generation  
- **Ethical AI**: Fairness, bias mitigation, and inclusive language modeling  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
**Languages & Libraries**: Python, R, SQL, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, Scikit-learn  
**NLP & Speech**: Transformers, SpaCy, Librosa, Praat, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
**Other**: Git, Docker, MLOps (learning)

## 🚀 Current Projects
- 🎙️ **[SER in Noise](https://github.com/kanincityy/ser_in_noise)**: Speech emotion recognition under white noise (MSc dissertation)  
- 🛡️ **[Misogyny Detection](https://github.com/kanincityy/hate_speech_detection_transformers)**: Low-resource Swedish misogyny classification with multilingual Transformers 
- 🐾 **[Veterinary Discharge Note Generator](https://github.com/kanincityy/vet_discharge_note_generator)**: LLM-based tool that generates client-ready notes from structured JSON data

---

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Advanced NLP architectures (LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- AI fairness metrics and debiasing strategies  
- Lightweight model deployment (FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker)
