# Hi, I’m Tatiana! 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m an MSc Language Sciences student at UCL, specialising in Technology of Language and Speech.

I'm passionate about computational linguistics, language technologies, and how machine learning can be applied to speech and language. I love working on projects that bridge the gap between language and technology, and I’m always excited to explore new ways to make language processing more accessible, robust, and accurate.

### 🔬 My Technical Interests:

*   **Computational Linguistics:** Investigating the theoretical underpinnings of language processing, particularly in the context of noisy, real-world data and low-resource languages.
*   **Language Technology:** Developing robust NLP models (especially Transformers, RNNs) that can effectively handle the complexities of real-world text and speech.
*   **Machine Learning for Speech:** Applying ML techniques to challenges in speech processing, like Speech Emotion Recognition in noise.
*   **Responsible AI:** Thinking critically about the ethical implications and fairness of language technologies. 

### 🔭 I’m Currently Working On:

*   My MSc in Language Sciences research focused on **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** in low-SNR white noise environments.
*   Exploring cross-lingual transfer learning techniques (zero-shot, fine-tuning) with **Transformers (Hugging Face)** for **hate speech detection** in low-resource languages (like Swedish).
*   Sharpening my Python skills and exploring MLOps concepts.

### 🌱 I’m Currently Learning:

*   Advanced Deep Learning architectures for NLP.
*   Techniques for evaluating AI fairness and mitigating bias.

### 📫 How to Reach Me:

*   LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tatiana-limonova/]
*   Portfolio: [COMING SOON]

### 😄 Fun Facts:

*   Fluent in 5 languages thanks to a multicultural upbringing (Russia -> Spain -> UK).
*   Love discovering new cultures through travel.
*   Enjoy reading (and sometimes writing!) fiction and poetry.
*   Occasional Advent of Code participant!
