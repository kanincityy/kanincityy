# Hi, I‚Äôm Tatiana! 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I‚Äôm an MSc **Language Sciences** student at **UCL**, specialising in **Technology of Language and Speech**. 

I'm passionate about **computational linguistics**, **language technologies**, and how **machine learning** can be applied to speech and language. I love working on projects that bridge the gap between language and technology, and I‚Äôm always excited to explore new ways to make language processing more accessible and accurate. 

## My Interests:
- **Computational Linguistics**: Investigating the theoretical underpinnings of language processing, particularly in the context of noisy, real-world data and low-resource languages
- **Language Technology**: Developing robust NLP models that can effectively handle the complexities of real-world text, including typographical errors, informal language, and other linguistic variations.
- **Travel**: Discovering new cultures and languages around the world.
- **Literature**: Reading (and occasionally writing) fiction and poetry that brings language to life.

## What I‚Äôm Working On:
- **MSc in Language Sciences** at UCL.
- Specialisation in **Technology of Language and Speech**.
- Ongoing research in **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** and **Machine Learning** applications for **low-SNR speech processing**.
