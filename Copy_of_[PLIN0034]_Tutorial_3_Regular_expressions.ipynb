For example, in English, the word \"not\" is often attached as the clitic \"n't\" to modal verbs or various forms of the verb \"be\" or \"do\" (e.g., \"don't\" instead of \"do not\").\n",

        "\n",
        "In this optional (very challenging!) exercise, you can practice implementing things from scratch by implementing the ELIZA chatbot. ELIZA was a program developed by Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s that emulated a Rogerian psychotherapist, a kind of therapist who often questions or paraphrases what patients say.\n",
        "\n",
        "The entire system is based on regular expressions: There are regular expressions that try to categorise different answers and there are regular expressions for extracting parts of the patient's utterance so that it can be repeated by ELIZA.\n",
        "\n",
        "ELIZA was somewhat controversial since some people who interacted with it thought it was an actual human (see the Wikipedia article of [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) for more info on that.)\n",
        "\n",
        "### A possible implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to implement ELIZA is to use the rules specified in the following file:\n",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wadetb/eliza/refs/heads/master/doctor.txt\n",
        "\n",
        "This file has several sections:\n",
        "* Line beginning with \"initial\": The first utterance by the chatbot.\n",
        "* Line beginning with \"final\": The last line of the chatbot.\n",
        "* Lines beginning with \"quit\": If a user says any of these words, ELIZA should output what is written in final.\n",
        "* Lines beginning with \"pre\": The first string should be replaced with the second string before processing the user input.\n",
        "* Lines beginning with \"post\": Before outputting anything, the first string should be replaced with the second string.\n",
        "* Lines beginning with \"synon\": Synonyms that are used in part of the rules\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The actual response rules are then defined in the rest of the file. Let's look at one of the rules:\n",

        "key: remember 5\n",

        "    reasmb: Does thinking of (2) bring anything else to mind ?\n",
        "    reasmb: What else do you recollect ?\n",
        "    reasmb: Why do you recollect (2) just now ?\n",
        "    reasmb: What in the present situation reminds you of (2) ?\n",

        "  decomp: * do you remember *\n",
        "    reasmb: Did you think I would forget (2) ?\n",
        "    reasmb: Why do you think I should recall (2) now ?\n",
        "    reasmb: What about (2) ?\n",
        "    reasmb: goto what\n",
        "    reasmb: You mentioned (2) ?\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `key` defines which word this rule should be matched to. You can ignore the number after the word for your implementation. Any utterance that contains \"remember\" should use these rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "`decomp` defines more specific rules including matching groups. `* i remember *` describes an expression where there are two matching groups of any (potentially empty) string, one before \"i remember\", and another after \"i remember\".\n",
        "\n",
        "`reasmb`: Describes the response templates. Whenever there is a string such as \"sometimes, I remember going to the park\", then you can choose any of the response templates. Numbers in parentheses (e.g., (2)) should be replaced with the corresponding group, e.g., \"going to the park\" in the example above.\n",

        "3. Automatically rewrite all the rules so that they are valid python regular expressions that can be used for the `re.match` and `re.sub` functions.\n",
        "4. Write code that pre-processed the user input, applies the rules, post-processes the output and outputs the string.\n",
