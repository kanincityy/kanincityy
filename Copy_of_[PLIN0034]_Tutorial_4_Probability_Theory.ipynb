        "As we discussed in Lecture 4, we can represent the probability of typing a character $r$ instead of a character $i$ as $P(r \\mid i)$. In this exercise, you will compute the probabilities from a file of simulated typos.\n",
        "\n",
        "The file contains two words per line (separated by a space): the first one corresponds to the user's intention (i.e., the correct word) and the second one corresponds to what the user typed. In the majority of cases, these two words will be identical but sometimes one or a few letters will have been substituted. We are asssuming here that substitutions are the only typos users make, so you can assume that both the intended word and the typed word will always have the same number of characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your job is to read in the file and build up a dictionary of dictionaries `P_r_i` where the entry `P_r_i[i][r]` corresponds to the probability of producing letter `r` given intention `i`.\n",

        "A few hints:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Remember that you can use for loops to go through each character of a string, e.g., the following snippet will loop through each character in the string `word` and print one character a time.\n",

        "for c in word:\n",
        "    print(c)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "total = sum(d.values())\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
